question 3:
A: What is reverse-i-search in a Linux terminal?
answ:
	In addition to aggressively employing tab-autocompleting, 
I frequently utilise reverse-i-search to look up previous commands.
To find matches, start reverse-i-search by pressing Ctrl+r and then enter a search term.
Once more, press Ctrl+r to discover the next match.
